## Description

_This is my fourth official webpage that is posted on gh-pages (it can be found here: https://mavizzle.github.io/code-review-4/), which includes a Pizza order generator that takes a user inputs (pizza size/topppings) and returns the order back in a user friendly manner and calculates the price. It includes an index.html, Bootstrap 1.3, custom CSS stylesheet, and jQuery 3.3.1._

## **Specs for the Pizza Order Webpage**

* _The webpage should take more user inputs for pizza toppings via checkboxes_
  * _Input Example: Pineapple, Extra cheese selected_
  * _Output Example: "Pineapple, Extra Cheese"_

* _The webpage creates a Pizza constructor and stores the user information'_
  * _Input Example: var newPizza = new Pizza(pizzaSize, numChecks, toppings);_
  * _Output Example: 'PizzaÂ {size: "Medium", toppings: Array(2), checkedBoxes: 2, toppingDisplay: "Mushrooms, Green Peppers", price: 10}'_

* _The webpage uses a constructor prototype to turn the list of toppings into a readable list.'_
  * _Input Example: ['Pineapple, Mushrooms, Pepperoni]_
  * _Output Example: Pineapple, Mushrooms, Pepperoni_

* _The webpage uses another prototype to calculate the price for a pizza order_
